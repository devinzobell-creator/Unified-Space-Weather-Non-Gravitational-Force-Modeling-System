# Unified-Space-Weather-Non-Gravitational-Force-Modeling-System
The USWF program will build a real-time, uncertainty-aware force modeling system for OD, conjunctions, maneuvers, and replay, computing drag/SRP/albedo with covariance, detection, and rule+ML attribution. Delivered in 54 months with p99&lt;60s, ≥80% precision, R=0.8–1.2, and 10-year retention.
